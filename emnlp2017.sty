% 2017: modified to support DOI links in bibliography.  Now uses
% natbib package rather than defining citation commands in this file.
% Use with acl_natbib.bst bib style.  -- Dan Gildea

% This is the LaTeX style for ACL 2016. It contains Margaret Mitchell's
% line number adaptations (ported by Hai Zhao and Yannick Versley).

% It is nearly identical to the style files for ACL 2015,
% ACL 2014, EACL 2006, ACL2005, ACL 2002, ACL 2001, ACL 2000,
% EACL 95 and EACL 99. 
%
% Changes made include: adapt layout to A4 and centimeters, widen abstract

% This is the LaTeX style file for ACL 2000.  It is nearly identical to the
% style files for EACL 95 and EACL 99.  Minor changes include editing the
% instructions to reflect use of \documentclass rather than \documentstyle
% and removing the white space before the title on the first page
% -- John Chen, June 29, 2000

% This is the LaTeX style file for EACL-95.  It is identical to the
% style file for ANLP '94 except that the margins are adjusted for A4
% paper.  -- abney 13 Dec 94

% The ANLP '94 style file is a slightly modified
% version of the style used for AAAI and IJCAI, using some changes
% prepared by Fernando Pereira and others and some minor changes 
% by Paul Jacobs.

% Papers prepared using the aclsub.sty file and acl.bst bibtex style
% should be easily converted to final format using this style.  
% (1) Submission information (\wordcount, \subject, and \makeidpage)
% should be removed.
% (2) \summary should be removed.  The summary material should come
% after \maketitle and should be in the ``abstract'' environment
% (between \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract}).
% (3) Check all citations.  This style should handle citations correctly
% and also allows multiple citations separated by semicolons.
% (4) Check figures and examples.  Because the final format is double-
% column, some adjustments may have to be made to fit text in the column
% or to choose full-width (\figure*} figures.

% Place this in a file called aclap.sty in the TeX search path.  
% (Placing it in the same directory as the paper should also work.)

% Prepared by Peter F. Patel-Schneider, liberally using the ideas of
% other style hackers, including Barbara Beeton.
% This style is NOT guaranteed to work.  It is provided in the hope
% that it will make the preparation of papers easier.

% There are undoubtably bugs in this style.  If you make bug fixes,
% improvements, etc.  please let me know.  My e-mail address is:

% Papers are to be prepared using the ``emnlp_natbib'' bibliography style,
% as follows:
%       \documentclass[11pt]{article}
%       \usepackage{emnlp2017}
%       \title{Title}
%       \author{Author 1 \and Author 2 \\ Address line \\ Address line \And
%               Author 3 \\ Address line \\ Address line}
%       \begin{document}
%       ...
%       \bibliography{bibliography-file}
%       \bibliographystyle{emnlp_natbib}
%       \end{document}

% Author information can be set in various styles:
% For several authors from the same institution:
% \author{Author 1 \and ... \and Author n \\
%         Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% if the names do not fit well on one line use
%         Author 1 \\ {\bf Author 2} \\ ... \\ {\bf Author n} \\
% For authors from different institutions:
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \And  ... \And
%         Author n \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% To start a seperate ``row'' of authors use \AND, as in
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \AND
%         Author 2 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line \And
%         Author 3 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}

% If the title and author information does not fit in the area allocated,
% place \setlength\titlebox{<new height>} right after
% \usepackage{emnlp2017}
% where <new height> can be something larger than 5cm

% include hyperref, unless user specifies nohyperref option like this:
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{emnlp2017}
\newif\ifemnlp@hyperref
\DeclareOption{hyperref}{\emnlp@hyperreftrue}
\DeclareOption{nohyperref}{\emnlp@hyperreffalse}
\ExecuteOptions{hyperref} % default is to use hyperref
\ProcessOptions\relax
\ifemnlp@hyperref
  \RequirePackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{xcolor}		% make links dark blue
  \definecolor{darkblue}{rgb}{0, 0, 0.5}
  \hypersetup{colorlinks=true,citecolor=darkblue, linkcolor=darkblue, urlcolor=darkblue}
\else
  % This definition is used if the hyperref package is not loaded.
  % It provides a backup, no-op definiton of \href.
  % This is necessary because \href command is used in the acl_natbib.bst file.
  \def\href#1#2{{#2}}
\fi


\RequirePackage{natbib}
% for citation commands in the .tex, authors can use:
% \citep, \citet, and \citeyearpar for compatibility with natbib, or
% \cite, \newcite, and \shortcite for compatibility with older ACL .sty files
\renewcommand\cite{\citep}	% to get "(Author Year)" with natbib    
\newcommand\shortcite{\citeyearpar}% to get "(Year)" with natbib    
\newcommand\newcite{\citet}	% to get "Author (Year)" with natbib
