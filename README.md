# Latex Thesis Template 

> View and this template in Overleaf clicking [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fpwdbshkbbpj).

This repository contains a full-fledged LaTeX thesis template that has been specifically customized for the department of TMI at the Graduate School of Engineering, the University of Tokyo. The `thesis.cls` template provides generic functionality, though, and can be easily adapted or extended to include additional features. 

In its current version there is full support for Japanese input, and the template complies with the requirements for both Master's and Ph.D. theses.

The template utilizes `bibtex` for managing references, and the [ACL](http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml) style for citations, similar to APA. 

In order to ensure full support for the Japanese language, needs to be compiled with XeLatex. If you use Overleaf make sure you set this correctly. 

Enjoy!
